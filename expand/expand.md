### 1. Why might JavaScript be considered a pain point?

JavaScript can be a pain point for some developers due to:
- **Asynchronous Nature**: Its non-blocking model using callbacks, promises, and async/await can be hard to reason about, especially for beginners.
- **Loose Typing**: Variables can change types dynamically, which may lead to bugs that are only caught at runtime.
- **Browser Inconsistencies**: Code might behave differently in different browsers due to varying implementations of JavaScript engines.

### 2. Why was JavaScript designed this way?

JavaScript was designed to be:
- **Loosely typed** to make it easier and faster to write code for simple web tasks.
- **Asynchronous** to allow web pages to remain responsive while waiting for I/O operations (like fetching data) to complete.

### 3. Compiled vs. Interpreted Languages

- **Compiled Languages** (e.g., C++, Java): Code is translated into machine code before execution.
- **Interpreted Languages** (e.g., JavaScript): Code is run line-by-line by an interpreter.
- **JavaScript is interpreted**, which allows for faster prototyping and dynamic execution, but makes it easier to introduce runtime errors.

### 4. Why focus on vanilla JavaScript?

The professor wants students to understand the **fundamentals** before jumping into frameworks. Mastering vanilla JavaScript helps:
- Build a solid foundation.
- Debug framework issues more effectively.
- Avoid over-reliance on tools.

Frameworks can be powerful, but without core understanding, they can obscure whatâ€™s actually happening under the hood.

### 5. How does this lab relate to your project?

This lab helps with:
- Understanding how the browser executes JavaScript and manages network/data flow.
- Practicing debugging, which is crucial during development.
- Learning about pipelines and proper code delivery, which are essential for collaborative projects.
